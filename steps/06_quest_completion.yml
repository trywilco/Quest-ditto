              Let's review what you've accomplished:
          - text: "ðŸŒŸ You've learned about Ditto's powerful offline-first architecture\n
              ðŸŒŸ Set up Ditto in an Android application\n
              ðŸŒŸ Implemented core data operations (get, add, update, archive)\n
              ðŸŒŸ Created a robust sync system with MongoDB\n
              ðŸŒŸ Built a resilient data layer that works even without constant connectivity"
          - text: Your app now has superpowers - it can handle data operations seamlessly,
              whether online or offline. This is exactly the kind of reliability that
              modern apps need. Great job implementing these features!
          - text: Keep exploring Ditto's capabilities, and remember - with great power
              comes great responsibility (and fantastic data sync)! ðŸš€
