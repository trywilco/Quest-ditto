learningObjectives:
  - Implement the getPlanets flow in DittoServiceImp
hints:
  - Look at the DittoServiceImp class in the com.ditto.guides.services package
  - The getPlanets method should query non-archived planets and order them by distance from the sun

          - text: Take a look at the DittoServiceImp class in the services package. You'll see
              that it already has the structure set up, including comments explaining what
              each method should do. Let's focus on implementing the getPlanets method first.
          - text: Once you've implemented getPlanets, create a pull request so we can check
              your implementation before moving on to the other methods. Remember, we want
              to query only non-archived planets and order them by their distance from the sun.

            The getPlanets implementation should:
            Creates a Flow that observes and emits changes to the planets collection in Ditto.
            The method:
            - Sets up a live query observer for the planets collection
            - Emits a new list of planets whenever the data changes
            - Automatically cleans up the observer when the flow is cancelled
            The query:
            - Returns all non-archived planets (isArchived = false)
            - Orders the results by distance from the sun
            - Transforms raw Ditto data into Planet objects

            return A flow that emits updated lists of planets whenever changes occur in the collection
